**An AI-powered rich text editor that transforms how you write and edit content.**

Smartext merges a high-quality rich text editor with OpenAI's GPT and Anthropic's Claude models to offer intelligent writing help. Unlike standard AI writing tools that produce full documents, this app emphasizes clear, contextual editing within your current content.

## Features

### Intelligent Content Editing

- **Contextual AI Commands**: Ask the AI to edit specific paragraphs, add content at exact positions, or format selections.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Chat with AI while maintaining full control over your document.
- **Tool-based Precision**: AI uses structured commands to make specific changes instead of redoing everything.

### Professional Writing Experience

- **Rich Text Editor**: Full-featured editor with markdown support, tables, lists, and formatting.
- **Split-pane Interface**: Work with your document and the AI assistant side-by-side.
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Comfortable writing in any setting.
- **Distraction-free**: Clean, modern interface that keeps you focused on your content.

### Developer-friendly Architecture

- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 16, Lexical editor, and Vercel AI SDK.
- **Tool Calling**: Advanced AI integration using structured commands.
- **Type-safe**: Fully implemented in TypeScript with thorough linting.
- **Performance-first**: Uses Turbopack for fast development.

## Why This Approach is Promising

### Beyond Simple AI Writing

Most AI writing tools either:

- Generate entire documents from scratch, losing your voice and style.
- Provide general suggestions that lack understanding of context.

Smartext takes a different approach:

- **Precision Editing**: Make specific changes to exact locations in your text.
- **Contextual Understanding**: AI sees your entire document for better suggestions.
- **Incremental Improvement**: Improve your existing content instead of replacing it.
- **Collaborative Workflow**: You remain in control while AI provides targeted help.

### Technical Innovation

- **Structured AI Commands**: Uses tool calling for precise, reliable text changes.
- **Real-time Streaming**: View AI responses and changes as they occur.
- **State Synchronization**: The editor and chat interface stay perfectly in sync.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add new AI capabilities and editor features.

## What's Coming Next

### Enhanced AI Capabilities

- **Multi-model Support**: Integration with Claude, Gemini, and other leading AI models.
- **Specialized Writing Modes**: Academic writing, technical documentation, and creative writing assistance.
- **Research Integration**: AI that can fact-check, add citations, and retrieve relevant information.
- **Style Consistency**: AI that learns and maintains your writing style across documents.

### Advanced Editor Features

- **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time editing with AI support for teams.
- **Version History**: Track changes with AI-powered change summaries.
- **Template System**: Smart templates that adjust to your content and industry.

- Supabase CLI
- Docker for running local Supabase instance
- Clerk development keys for local authentication

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/domhhv/smartext.git
   cd smartext
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in required environment variables in .env.local
   ```

4. **Boot local Supabase instance**

   [Install Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=macos), open Docker Desktop, and run:

   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

5. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open the application**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Development

### Essential Commands

```bash
npm run dev             # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking
npm run eslint:check    # Code linting
npm run eslint:fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run prettier:check  # Code formatting check
npm run prettier:write  # Auto-format code
```

**Important**: Always run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run eslint:check`, and `npm run prettier:check` after making changes. These are part of the prebuild process and must pass for production builds.
